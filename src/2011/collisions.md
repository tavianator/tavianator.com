This animation is of one of Dimension's test scenes, physically integrated with collision detection and gravity.
Each collision is perfectly elastic.
The 1000-sphere scene was integrated and collision-detected 100 times per frame.
The integration and rendering took 30 minutes on 12 cores, or 3 hours of CPU time.
You should watch in HD.

Collisions were detected using a na√Øve `$O(n^2)$` algorithm, but rendering time (23 minutes wall-clock, 173 minutes CPU time) still dwarfed integration time (7 minutes).
