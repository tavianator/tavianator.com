At the end of 2024, Harold Aptroot posted this:

I was immediately [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) because I am into low-level performance analysis, and I happen to own an Alder Lake laptop.

A bit of background: [*Alder Lake*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake) is the 12th generation of Intel Core processors.
It's the first generation with a "hybrid architecture," containing both performance (P) and efficiency (E) cores.
[`shlx`](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sarx:shlx:shrx) is a left-shift instruction introduced in the [BMI2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_Bit_manipulation_instruction_set#BMI2_(Bit_Manipulation_Instruction_Set_2)) instruction set.
The main difference with [`SHL`](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sal:sar:shl:shr) is that `shlx` doesn't affect the [`flags`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register) register.
It's also a 3-operand instruction:

```x86asm
        shl  rax, cl       ; rax = rax << cl
                           ; (only cl allowed as shift count)

        shlx rax, rbx, rdx ; rax = rbx << rdx
                           ; (any register allowed as shift count)
```

Left-shift is one of the simplest things to implement in hardware, so it's quite surprising that it should take 3 whole CPU cycles.
It's been 1 cycle on every other CPU I'm aware of.
It's even 1 cycle on Alder Lake's *efficiency cores*!
Only the performance cores have this particular performance problem.

The 3-cycle figure Harold cited comes from [uops.info](https://uops.info/html-instr/shlx_R64_R64_R64.html#ADL-P).
They even document the exact [instruction sequence](https://uops.info/html-lat/ADL-P/shlx_R64_R64_R64-Measurements.html#lat2-%3E1) used in their benchmark that measured the 3-cycle latency, with a sample [nanoBench](https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench) command to reproduce it.
Running that command on my laptop indeed measures 3 cycles of latency.

On the other hand, other sources (like [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html) and [InstLatX64](http://users.atw.hu/instlatx64/GenuineIntel/GenuineIntel00906A4_AlderLakeP_00_BC_InstLatX64.txt)) claim the latency is 1 cycle.
What gives?
I decided to write my own benchmark to try to understand the discrepancy.

```x86asm
.intel_syntax noprefix
.globl main
main:
        mov rdx, 10000     ; rdx = 10000
        xor rax, rax       ; rax = 0
.LOOP:
        mov rcx, 1         ; rcx = 1
.rept 10000
        shlx rax, rax, rcx ; rax = rax << rcx
                           ; (repeated 10,000 times)
.endr
        dec rdx
        jnz .LOOP          ; (loop 10,000 times)
        xor eax, eax
        ret                ; return 0
```

This code contains an outer loop with 10,000 iterations.
Inside the loop, we initialize `rcx` to 1, then run `shlx rax, rax, rcx` 10,000 times.
In total, we run `shlx` 10,000,000 times, so all the other instructions (including the ones before `main()` runs) are negligible.
I used `taskset -c 0` to pin it to a P core, and `perf` for measurement:

```console
$ gcc shlx.s -o shlx
$ taskset -c 0 perf stat --cputype=core -e 'cycles,instructions' ./shlx

 Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       301,614,809      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,155,910      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    0.33  insn per cycle
```

Here we see 0.33 instructions per cycle, a.k.a. 3-cycle latency.

Let's try initializing `rcx` differently:

```diff
 .LOOP:
-        mov rcx, 1
+        mov ecx, 1
```

`ecx` is the 32-bit low half of the 64-bit `rcx` register.
On x86-64, writing a 32-bit register implicitly sets the upper half of the corresponding 64-bit register to zero.
So these two instructions should behave identically.
And yet:

```
 Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       100,321,870      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,155,867      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    1.00  insn per cycle
```

It seems like `shlx` performs differently depending on how the shift count register is initialized.
If you use a 64-bit instruction with an immediate, performance is slow.
This is also true for instructions like `inc` (which is similar to `add` with a 1 immediate).

```diff
 .LOOP:
-        mov rcx, 1
+        xor rcx, rcx
+        inc rcx
```

```
 Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       300,138,108      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,165,881      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    0.33  insn per cycle
```

On the other hand, 32-bit instructions, and 64-bit instructions without immediates (even no-op ones), make it fast.
All of these ways to initialize rcx lead to 1-cycle latency:

```x86asm
.LOOP:
        mov ecx, 1
```

```x86asm
.LOOP:
        xor rcx, rcx
```

```x86asm
.LOOP:
        mov rcx, 1
        mov rcx, rcx
```

```x86asm
        mov rcx, 1
.LOOP:
        push rcx
        pop rcx
```

It is very strange to me that the *instruction used to set the shift count register* can make the `shlx` instruction 3&times; slower.
The 32-bit vs. 64-bit operand size distinction is especially surprising to me as `shlx` only looks at the bottom 6 bits of the shift count.

~~I do not have a good explanation for this yet, but I will update this page if I ever figure it out.~~
