Finding the tightest axis-aligned bounding box for a sphere is trivial: the box extends from the center by the radius in all dimensions.
But once the sphere is transformed, finding the minimal bounding box becomes trickier.
Rotating a sphere, for example, shouldn't change its bounding box, but naïvely rotating the bounding box will expand it unnecessarily.
Luckily there's a trick to computing minimal bounding boxes by representing the transformed sphere as a [quadric surface].

[quadric surface]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric

A description of the technique can be found on Yining Karl Li's blog [here], and in [this] Stack Overflow answer.
Unfortunately, both descriptions gloss over the math, as well as some details that give rise to a simple and efficient implementation.
The post on Li's blog also contains a small bug.
In contrast, this post examines the technique in full detail.
It relies on the [projective representation of a quadric].

[projective representation of a quadric]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric#Projective_geometry

A sphere of radius 1, centred at the origin, can be defined as the set of points where `$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$`.
For the homogeneous point `$\vec{p} = \begin{bmatrix}x & y & z & 1\end{bmatrix}^\top$`, the same sphere can be defined by

```math
\vec{p}^\top \, \mathbf{S} \, \vec{p} = 0,
```

where

```math
\mathbf{S} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
```

If an arbitrary affine transformation `$\mathbf{M}$` is applied to the sphere, the equation becomes

```math
\begin{aligned}
(\mathbf{M}^{-1}\,\vec{p})^\top \, \mathbf{S} \, (\mathbf{M}^{-1}\,\vec{p}) & = \vec{p}^\top \, (\mathbf{M}^{-\mathrm{T}}\,\mathbf{S}\,\mathbf{M}^{-1}) \, \vec{p} \\
{} & = 0.
\end{aligned}
```

We denote this transformed quadric matrix by `$\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{M}^{-\mathrm{T}}\,\mathbf{S}\,\mathbf{M}^{-1}$`.
Note that `$\mathbf{Q}$` is symmetric.


## The Dual Form

The minimal bounding box for this surface will be tangent to it, so we need to find an expression for its tangent planes.
In homogeneous coordinates, a plane can be represented by a row vector `$\vec{u}^\top$` such that `$\vec{u}\cdot\vec{p} = 0$`.
For a point `$\vec{p}$` on the surface, the plane `$\vec{u}^\top = \vec{p}^\top \, \mathbf{Q}$` touches the quadric at `$\vec{p}$`, since

```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{u}\cdot\vec{p} & = \vec{u}^\top \, \vec{p} \\
{} & = \vec{p}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \vec{p} \\
{} & = 0.
\end{aligned}
```

Furthermore, this must be the unique intersection point.
To see why, consider a point `$\vec{q} = \vec{p} + r\,\hat{r}$` that falls on both the plane and the quadric.

```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{q}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \vec{q} & = (\vec{p} + r\,\hat{r})^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \vec{q} \\
{} & = \vec{u}\cdot\vec{p} + r\,\hat{r}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \vec{q} \\
{} & = r \, (\vec{q}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \hat{r})^\top \\
{} & = r^2 \, (\hat{r}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \hat{r}) \\
{} & = 0.
\end{aligned}
```

If `$\hat{r}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \hat{r}$` is zero, then the whole line `$\vec{p} + t\,\hat{r}$` must lie on the quadric, which is impossible since its surface is curved.
Therefore `$r = 0$` and `$\vec{q} = \vec{p}$`.
Since the plane has exactly one point in common with the quadric, `$\vec{u}^\top$` must be the tangent plane at that point.
This gives a nice characterization of the tangent planes:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{u}^\top \, \mathbf{Q}^{-1} \, \vec{u} & = \vec{p}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \mathbf{Q}^{-1} \, \mathbf{Q} \, \vec{p} \\
{} & = \vec{p}^\top \, \mathbf{Q} \, \vec{p} \\
{} & = 0.
\end{aligned}
```


## Solving for the Planes

Let `$\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{Q}^{-1} = \mathbf{M} \, \mathbf{S}^{-1} \, \mathbf{M}^\top$`.
Like `$\mathbf{Q}$`, `$\mathbf{R}$` is symmetric.
We want to find axis-aligned planes `$\vec{u}^\top$` such that `$\vec{u}^\top \, \mathbf{R} \, \vec{u} = 0$`.
The plane perpendicular to `$\hat{x}$` looks like `$\vec{u}^\top = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & -x\end{bmatrix}$`, so we have

```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{u}^\top \, \mathbf{R} \, \vec{u} & =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & -x
\end{bmatrix}
\,
\mathbf{R}
\,
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
0 \\
-x \\
\end{bmatrix} \\
{} & =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & -x
\end{bmatrix}
\,
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{R}_{1,1} - \mathbf{R}_{1,4}\,x \\
\mathbf{R}_{2,1} - \mathbf{R}_{2,4}\,x \\
\mathbf{R}_{3,1} - \mathbf{R}_{3,4}\,x \\
\mathbf{R}_{4,1} - \mathbf{R}_{4,4}\,x \\
\end{bmatrix} \\
{} & = \mathbf{R}_{4,4}\,x^2 - (\mathbf{R}_{1,4} + \mathbf{R}_{4,1})\,x + \mathbf{R}_{1,1} \\
{} & = \mathbf{R}_{4,4}\,x^2 - 2\,\mathbf{R}_{1,4}\,x + \mathbf{R}_{1,1} \\
{} & = 0 \\
x & = \frac{\mathbf{R}_{1,4} \pm \sqrt{\mathbf{R}_{1,4}^2 - \mathbf{R}_{1,1}\,\mathbf{R}_{4,4}}}{\mathbf{R}_{4,4}}. \\
\end{aligned}
```

Similarly, the `$\hat{y}$` and `$\hat{z}$` planes are given by

```math
\begin{aligned}
y & = \frac{\mathbf{R}_{2,4} \pm \sqrt{\mathbf{R}_{2,4}^2 - \mathbf{R}_{2,2}\,\mathbf{R}_{4,4}}}{\mathbf{R}_{4,4}} \\
z & = \frac{\mathbf{R}_{3,4} \pm \sqrt{\mathbf{R}_{3,4}^2 - \mathbf{R}_{3,3}\,\mathbf{R}_{4,4}}}{\mathbf{R}_{4,4}}. \\
\end{aligned}
```

This is where the above linked posts stop, but a lot more simplification can be done.


## Implementation Details

Several details of the problem can make computing the planes more efficient.
The first is that `$\mathbf{S}$` is involutory, meaning `$\mathbf{S}^{-1} = \mathbf{S}$`.
This means that the product `$\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{S}^{-1}$` can be computed implicitly: it is simply `$\mathbf{M}$` with its last column negated.
The last column of `$\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{M} \, \mathbf{S}^{-1} \, \mathbf{M}^\top$` is the same, because the last column of `$\mathbf{M}^\top$` is `$\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^\top$`.
In particular, `$\mathbf{R}_{4,4} = -1$`.

Not all values of `$\mathbf{R}$` are used; in fact, only values from the last column and the diagonal appear in the formulae.
We know the last column implicitly, and the diagonal has the formula

```math
\mathbf{R}_{i,i} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^3 \mathbf{M}_{i,j}^2\right) - \mathbf{M}_{i,4}^2.
```

Plugging this identity into the plane equations simplifies them greatly:

```math
\begin{aligned}
x & = \mathbf{M}_{1,4} \pm \sqrt{\mathbf{M}_{1,1}^2 + \mathbf{M}_{1,2}^2 + \mathbf{M}_{1,3}^2} \\
y & = \mathbf{M}_{2,4} \pm \sqrt{\mathbf{M}_{2,1}^2 + \mathbf{M}_{2,2}^2 + \mathbf{M}_{2,3}^2} \\
z & = \mathbf{M}_{3,4} \pm \sqrt{\mathbf{M}_{3,1}^2 + \mathbf{M}_{3,2}^2 + \mathbf{M}_{3,3}^2}.
\end{aligned}
```

This makes at least some intuitive sense, since the fourth column of `$\mathbf{M}$` determines the sphere's translation.
See [here][impl] for an implementation in my ray tracer [Dimension].

That makes sense to me, as the axes would need to be unit lengths in order to be properly scaled by S, and being orthonormal and having a determinant of 1 shows that it's a purely rotational matrix. I confirm that graphically, but the axes don't line up with the axes of the ellipsoid data points.
